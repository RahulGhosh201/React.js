Now if we add onSubmit in the form we will see that while clicking on the task button
it will perform some certain tasks.
But it will show for some nano seconds to keep this change permanent we have to write e.preventDefault()
Then inside the setHandler function we have to write settitle("") and as a result of this the task written will be stored and page will not reload and the task bar will be empty like before.
