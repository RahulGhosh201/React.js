// DOM-Document Object Model
//It's the representation of your web page with whom your javascript can interract with.
//here actually it's like a tree structure where we can understand which code represent which part of the page.
//DOM manipulation meaning by using various methods such as 'getlementById'.,
//'getElementByClassName','getEleemntByTagName','querySelector' etc.
//like this-
    // const elementById = document.getElementById('myElement');
    // const elementsByClass = document.getElementsByClassName('myClass');
    //OR we can modify the content inside the elements using 'textContent', 'innerHTML', 'innerText'.

//React builds a virtual representation of the DOM. It creates a virtual DOM which is essntial to ake changes in the actual DOM.
//in case of react we use jsx in replacement of html which is a combination of javascript and html.
