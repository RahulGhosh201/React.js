props or properties are the inputs or arguments passed to the component.
State is the internal data managed by the component.
Props are similar to function args.
state are similar to local variables.
props are immutable meaning unchangable or read only.
state are mutable and that's the main purpose of using state.
But both of these are used to re render the dom meaning when ever we make some changes in 
both of this it changes the DOM.
