props are  inputs to our components.
when we are hard coding an array or writing a hading under h1 tag it makes the code static as to why 
if we want to change it in future or make it dynamic it may become imposiible and that;s why
we use interface.
interface defines the shape of an object.
mainly it works exactly like structure in c.
interface props {
    items: string[];
    heading: string;
}
by doing this we can number of props object.
and each object has it's own string[] arrays, string heading.
Mainly by doing this we can pass data dynamically.

Now in real apps after an item of the list group gets selected some operations need to be happened
and to that we have to notify the parent component that an item got selected.and in this case our parent component is 
our app component to do that we have to add that function in the existing interface.
