jsx(javascript xml)=javascript + HTML

const page = () => {
    const a=10;
    return (
        <div>a</div>;//it will show a only 
        <div>{a}</div>;//it will show 10
    )
}

Real DOM vs Virtual DOM ( Document Object Model )
In case of Real DOM, the HTML code write works as a DOM tree meaning like below-
Window -> HTML -> Body -> div -> element1
so if we make some changes in the div it will update the whole DOM tree.

But in case of Virtual DOM, it make some copies of original DOM tree whenever we make 
some changes in any part of it it just updates that part of the copied tree and then 
compare it to the original then updates it that's why in case of virtual DOM 
it does not reload we go to a new section of that page like for example if we go from trending 
to subscription section of youtube it does not reload.

and react works in virtual dom.


class is a reserved word that's why we have to use className.
