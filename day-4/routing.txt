routing means going from an page to another page without reloading the total page like suppose you are on youtube and then 
click on the trending section it goes to it you will notice that the url of both the pages are different but you will also notice that while
this switchinig between these two page happens the page does not reload.

Suppose we build header section in our site and it has About, Product and in case of both of these 
if we click on About it will transfer it to another page which is sole ly designed for about section and to do that
We have to create a folder named About in src  and then create a App.tsx
file and the content of that will be shown while clicked on About in the header.
also we have to link both this App.tsx file by writing-
<a href='About'>About</a>

But still we will see that it is reloading for going from main page to About page and to fix it 
we have to use link like this-
import Link from 'next/link'
<Link href='/About'>About</Link>
