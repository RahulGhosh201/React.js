axios is used to call the APIs.
API(Application Programming Interface) is used to communicate between softwares.
We can say that in the case of a restuarnt the front or dinning where all the customers are seated and where all the tables are placed or from where the cutsomers are able to communicatewith restuarnt is 
front-end where as the kitchen where all the cooking is done in the background can be descried as the back-end and the stuffs or servers that communicate with both the customers and cooks are the APIs.
meaning a customer came to the front-end request to their desire and then API taje that request and fetch that specific food or data from the kitchen or back-end.

To use these APIs we have to install axios in the terminal like this-
npm i axios
and then import it in the code like this-
import axios from 'axios'

Handling APIs-
suppose you want to fetch some random images by using this link (https://picsum.photos/v2/list)
then after installing the axios by npm i axios you have to create a function linke this-
const getImages = () =>{
    const response =axios.get(https://picsum.photos/v2/list);
}
<buton onClick={getImages}>Click Me</button>


But here you will see that you are getting is a response and to handle the responses we have to use asynch wait with try catch block
Response handling-
const getImages = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get("https://picsum.photos/v2/list");
      console.log(response.data);
    } catch {
      console.error("Error fetching images");
    }
}
It will retuen datas as an array of objects.

asynch wait makes a function asynchronous.
