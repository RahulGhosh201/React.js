Suppose we are writing some value on page.tsx file and we want to show that value via our Header.tsx file then
we have to use props.
At first in App.tsx file-
 <Header user={user} /> in the return section 

 and then in Header.tsx file-
 const { user } = this.props;

In this case we are passing an object to the header file so get various properties of that 
object we have to use "." 
like if we create two useStates named user and editor like this-
const [user,setUser] = useState("Rahul")
const [editor,SetEditor] = useState("Rohit")
and pass it to header file like this-
<header user={user} edit={editor}

and then catch it in the header file like this
const Header = (props){

}
This props is an object which has two properties here user and editor and to print them we have to write-
{props.user}, {props.edit}
