In the case of react, if we want to create a variable in the app.tsx file  whose value will be 
changed later on then it's better to create useState.

syntax: const [user,setUser]= useState("Rahul");

Here the value of this useState is Rahul and to change that in the future you have to do it by using setUser("value")

and to use useState you have to import it like this-
import React,{useState} from 'react';
