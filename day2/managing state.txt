whil clicking on an item if we want to highlight it we have a css class in bootstrap named active.
className="list-group-item active" by doing this it will highlight all the items together.

we are trying to highlight the item whuch are clicking and to do that we have to use react hook , react hooks are some built in functions 
that can be used by importing them.
here we are using state hook named useSate. using state hookwe are telling react that this component
can change data later on.

We will declare the hook by writing 
const arr =useState(-1);//initialized by value -1
and by this we are going to have two elements arr[0] which is a variable like our selectedIndex variable
arr[1] updater function. 

Intead of writing this-
const arr =useState(-1);
 we will write-
 const [selectedIndex, setSelectedINdex]= useState(-1);

 Also if we create two different ListGroups and then those will be selected independently.
