all the datas that a client wants are stored in the server's databases.
now whenever a client want to get some data, he has to send some request to the server
then if the site works on multi or non-single page application(mpa), the clien will get a combination of html+css+js files.
in case of mpa the site gets reloaded each time the client request some thing different from before.
But if the works on spa(single page application ), then the client gets a combination of html+css+js files and from there the js handels all the action takes place 
in that site meaning after getting the first response from the server side it does not gets reloaded when ever the client requests some thing new. the js file handels all
the requests from there on.
Mainly spa makes your site faster.
