jsx html hi he par o js k mukut pehni hui he
jsx=html+{js}
here mainly html is written and to add js init we use{}
here className is used in place of class as class is a keyword here.
htmlFor is used in place of for
tabIndex is used in place of index

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
) 
this code is present in the src folder's main.jsx file and it shows that it is connected to the root where main component
is App and this App is the file named App.jsx which gets imported in the main.jsx file.
If we create an element it gets imported in the App.jsx file and App.jsx file gets imported inthe main.jsx file
Or we can directly import that file in the main.jsx file

And mainly we can return only one tag so either make a div and insert all the code inside that div and return it 
Or you can make a fragement like <> </> and insert all the code inside that fragment and return it

Also suppose we want to render some component and use it in another component,
then just import that component in that file and in the return part write <componentNam />

Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls
means our syntax does not make the makes the changes directly it gets converted into some different codes by babel and then that makes the changes.
